# BIKE SHARE Project
This project is a part of the [Flatiron](http://https://flatironschool.com/) for Data Science
#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze the Trip History Data of Capital Bikeshare.  This will be my first solo project for Flatiron.

### Methods Used
* Time series analysis
* Data Visualization 
* Exponential smoothing forecasting
* Market Research


### Technologies
* Python
* Tableau
* Webscraping
* Pandas, geopy
* Jupyter
* Nominatum


## Project Description
Use of data analysis on Trip History data collected from [capital bike share](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) Collected all data from 2010 to 2019.   Used tableau for data visualization, data analysis, and forecasting.  Hope to find significant results exploring data to make recommendations for bike shares in the DC market.   

## Needs of this project

- Sourcing data
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- tableau
- findings
- writeup/reporting

## DATA

-  CSV files are not included in repo.   
-  Will need to source files from [Capital bike share](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)
-  Data was collected from trip history from 2010 to 2019 and is constantly updated.
- Data includes the following info:
        - Duration - Duration of trip
        - Start Date - Start date and time
        - End Date - End date and time
        - Start station - Station name and number
        - End station - Station name and number
        - Bike number - ID number of bike used for trip
        - Member type - Indicated registered or casual
## Getting Started

1. Trip data sourced from [Capital bike share](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) and used python to combine multiple csv files into 1 and put into Tableau for further analysis.
2. Notebook for project is called Bike_share_project found directly in this repo.   
3. Geocoding addresses find a way to get lat and long from addresses.
4. Using Geocoded addresses to show density distribution of bike stations.

## Analysis
* Most of bikes done through memberships
* Memberships use the bikes during the week casuals weekends
* Summer months with good weather have increased usage
* Growth has stalled and is in decline

## Recomendations
* Marketing
    Capital bikes has significant share of market still.  Put budget into marketing.
* Phase out poor performing stations
    Stations with less then 50 bike usage after 3 years do not need to be maintained and phased out.
* Emerging Tech
    Look at emerging technologies like e bikes and scooters those are the future.
## Future Improvements

- Get Tableau Desktop.  There are certain limitations using Tableau public that limits the amount of data you can analyze.  Tableau Desktop does not have those limitations.
- Work with tableau forecasting.  I want to test the accuracy of it's forecasting methods but that would require more data that Tableau public doesn't provided.
